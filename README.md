# RS_MLIP
This repository is for a project focused on Remotely Sensed Mountain Lake Ice Phenology (RS_MLIP). 

The scripts in this repository use Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data downloaded from Google Earth Engine (GEE). The GEE script extracts a time series of lake ice fractional coverage from which we derive ice phenology.

The remaining scripts then run analyses on the extracted ice phenology data.
